## How the Redesign Improved Results

- **Clarity:** Modular grid layout and modern typography (Satoshi for headings, Manrope for body) make the value proposition easy to scan and understand.
- **Trust:** Use of indigo blue (#5C6BC0) and mint green (#A5FFD6) builds a trustworthy, modern feel. Social proof and real company testimonials increase credibility.
- **Conversions:** Clear CTAs, explainer visuals, and integration highlights guide users toward starting a free trial, resulting in higher signup rates.
